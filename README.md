# Axolotlclient-Mod

The mod for Axolotlclient.

AxolotlClient is your customizable alternative to popular pvp clients, such as Lunar and Badlion.

Our goal is to create a better environment for everyone, including you, the user.

You should be in charge to decide what mods you want to use, and what data is sent to other people's servers (The only thing we use is your public UUID). This is only achievable through making everything open-source (You probably know what this means as you're currently using an open-source platform).

With AxolotlClient you are deciding what to use and what not. Every aspect of the mod is toggleable in over 200 options.

Disclaimers

I do not endorse nor support cheats/hacks. If you feel like one or more options packaged by this mod could be regarded as one of the above, please let us know and we'll remove the said options.

A pvp client in the context used above are launcher + game modifications combinations widely used on popular servers such as Hypixel and others. This is not meant in the context of cheats and/or hacks.

This mod is part of a larger package, which is available in our launcher (and soon also modpack). Since some people wished for it separately, it is also released here. All the other mods available and/or downloaded are respective property of their authors. We do not intend to infringe any copyright. If you are the author of a mod used by us and wish for it to be removed, please let us know.

To connect with things said above, the only thing that gets sent to our server is your public Minecraft account UUID. It will not be stored longer than one game session (from when you connect to a server/start a lan server to when you close the game). If you wish for your data to be deleted if it, for any instance has gotten to lure around the server longer, please also let us know and we will follow your request as soon as possible.
